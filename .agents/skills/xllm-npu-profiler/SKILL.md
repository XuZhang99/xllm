# Generate an xLLM NPU Profile

Launch or reuse an xLLM server, validate a representative request, capture a short
NPU trace, and return the exported timeline with Perfetto analysis. If the user
already has a trace, skip server startup and capture and begin with Step 5.

## Prerequisites

- A working xLLM NPU build, model files, and available Ascend devices.
- CANN `msprof` in the service environment and access to the service PID namespace.
- A server launch command and a request workload appropriate for the model.
- A local browser for [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev).

Follow `AGENTS.md` and resolve SSH targets, container names, mounts, checkout paths,
and script locations from the deployment. Compare local and remote branches,
HEADs, and relevant uncommitted files before synchronizing changes. If a build is
needed, run `python setup.py build` in the container checkout. Record the executable
actually used; a prebuilt binary does not validate a new build.

## Step-by-step workflow

### Step 1: Launch or reuse the server

Check device availability with `npu-smi info` and inspect existing services before
launching. Use the task's model, device allocation, parallelism, and graph settings.
Create a unique run directory and save launch arguments, environment versions,
commit, executable path, and server PID in `manifest.md`.

Set this variable in the **server's launch environment**:

```bash
export PROFILING_MODE=dynamic
# Run the deployment's xLLM launch command in this environment.
```

For an existing server, confirm that the variable was present at startup. Setting
it only in the profiler or request client has no effect on that server. Arrange
any required restart within the task's authorization. Resolve the service parent
PID inside its container; a worker PID from `npu-smi` is not a substitute.

See [capture setup](references/capture.md#1-confirm-the-execution-environment)
for environment checks and launch pitfalls.

### Step 2: Wait for readiness and warm up

Poll the deployment's readiness endpoint with a bounded timeout, inspect startup
logs, and send warmup requests. Stop on startup or request errors. An open port
alone does not prove that model execution or first-request HCCL setup works.
Complete graph capture and compilation warmup before starting profiling.

### Step 3: Validate the workload

Verify that a representative request succeeds and returns plausible model output.
Use an existing small accuracy check when the task requires accuracy validation;
choose expectations for the actual model rather than imposing a universal score.
Do not profile a known-broken workload as a successful run.

Record actual input/output token counts, concurrency, prefix-cache conditions,
and early EOS behavior in `workload.log`. A successful request is a sanity check,
not a full accuracy benchmark.

### Step 4: Capture and export the profile

Follow [capture.md](references/capture.md#2-warm-up-then-capture-a-bounded-window)
for executable commands. The required order is:

1. Attach `msprof --dynamic=on` to the verified service parent PID in the same
   PID namespace, using a fresh output directory.
2. Wait for attachment readiness and enter `start`.
3. Run the measured workload and verify all requests completed successfully.
4. Enter `stop`, confirm capture stopped, then enter `quit`. Wait for collector
   exit and data flush before exporting.
5. Export **every** `PROF_*` directory with `msprof --export=on` and retain logs.

Inspect `WorkerImpl::start_profile/stop_profile` in
`xllm/core/runtime/worker_impl.cpp` before choosing another capture mechanism.
The NPU path did not support the online HTTP profiler when this skill was added;
do not assume CUDA `/start_profile`, `/stop_profile`, or `--profile_dir` applies.
`enable_profile_step_time` and `ProfileManager` latency tables are not device traces.

### Step 5: Download and view the timeline

Locate complete `msprof_*.json` files, commonly under
`PROF_*/mindstudio_profiler_output/`. Existing `trace_view.json` or
`*.pt.trace.json` files are also candidates if their events are valid. Check for
nonempty timestamped events, record rank/device, size, and SHA-256, and verify the
local copy after download. Preserve directories for different ranks.

Open `https://ui.perfetto.dev`, choose **Open trace file**, and load the actual
local timeline. Confirm nonempty tracks and selectable slices. Inspect a
representative prefill interval and steady decode steps; save screenshots and
record the event names, tracks, time windows, and units supporting each conclusion.
See [Perfetto analysis](references/perfetto.md) for large traces, SQL, and
interpretation rules.

If browser import is unavailable, return the exact local path and manual loading
steps, and mark UI validation incomplete. CLI parsing or opening the welcome page
does not prove successful browser visualization.

### Step 6: Clean up and report

Stop collectors and temporary trace processors created for this run. Stop only
a server started for this task when it is no longer needed; preserve reused
services and unrelated jobs. Record the service's final state.

Return the local timeline and report paths, rank/device coverage, capture/export
status, and whether Perfetto visualization completed. Keep raw `PROF_*` data and
logs, including failure evidence. A useful artifact layout is:

```text
<run_id>/
  manifest.md           # Configuration, versions, executable, commit, parent PID
  capture.log           # Collector commands, timestamps, errors, exit status
  workload.log          # Warmup and measured request results
  export.log
  PROF_*/               # Raw data; may remain remote with paths in the manifest
  timelines/            # Verified local copies organized by rank/device
  timeline_notes.md     # Observations, interval evidence, hypotheses, next steps
  screenshots/          # Overview and selected intervals when UI analysis succeeds
```

## Customization

- **Prefill:** use long inputs and short outputs.
- **Decode:** capture enough steady decode steps and exclude the initial prefill
  interval from decode measurements.
- **Multiple ranks:** export all ranks; start with one representative rank and
  compare matching steps and clocks when investigating skew.
- **Graph execution:** preserve the deployment's graph mode. Use an additional
  eager capture only when needed for operator mapping.
- **Longer captures:** extend only enough to cover the behavior of interest;
  check storage and trace size before increasing the window.

Profiling explains bottlenecks. Validate any claimed speedup with matched
measurements taken with profiling disabled.
